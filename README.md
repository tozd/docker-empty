## Description

The idea of this Docker image is that you can mount a legacy system's root file system into a Docker container and run it.

One cannot mount the root to root, but you can mount manually each of the top-level directory.

## GitHub mirror

There is also a [read-only GitHub mirror available](https://github.com/tozd/docker-empty),
if you need to fork the project there.
